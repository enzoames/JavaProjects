Benford's Law
  - According to Benfordâ€™s law, in data in some large-enough numerical
    datasets, the first significant digit is 1 much more often than would be
    expected; in fact, 1 occurs as the first significant digit in the data
    almost 30% of the time, and 9 occurs less than 5% of the time

    benford.java determines whether the data in the data.txt file follows
    Benford's law.
